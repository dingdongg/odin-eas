# Etch-a-Sketch

## Description

Etch-a-Sketch is a website where you can create pixel drawings. The website features a simple GUI with a few buttons and a drawing canvas.

Using a combination of the customizable brush, bucket, and random coloring mode, you can draw just about anything you can think of! Start coloring the canvas simply by moving your mouse over the pixels you want to color in.

Finding your canvas "too" pixelated? Play around with the resolution slider :)

## Future ideas

There are a few things that I want to tweak with Etch-a-Sketch:
- Have the brush function apply only when holding the mouse down
- Make an "eraser" brush
